# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenvâ€™s dependency resolution may break, and should be added to .gitignore.
#   Uncomment the next line if you are using pyenv virtualenvs on macOS and Linux.
#Pipfile.lock

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow

# Streamlit files
# If you have files or folders specific to Streamlit that should not be included,
# add them below this line. For example, you might want to exclude your local
# 'data' directory if it contains large files that shouldn't be in your repo:
# data/

# IDE specific files
# You may want to exclude files specific to your IDE. Here are some examples for
